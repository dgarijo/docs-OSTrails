# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the OSTrails documentation! We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of your level of experience. This document outlines the process for contributing to the documentation.

## Ways of Contributing

- **Reporting Issues**: If you find a bug in the documentation, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
- **Suggesting Enhancements**: If you have an idea for improving the documentation, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
- **Improving the Documentation**: If you would like to improve the documentation, please follow the process outlined below.

## Issue Reporting

If you find a bug in the documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ostrails/docs/issues/new/choose) in the GitHub repository. When reporting an issue, please follow the requested information for given issue templates.

## Documentation

The documentation is hosted on Read-the-Docs and using standard Sphinx documentation. The documentation is written in reStructuredText (`.rst`) format. It can be compiled locally using Sphinx and viewed in a web browser.

### Writing Style

When contributing to the documentation, please follow the following writing style:

- Use British English.
- Use the active voice.
- Use the present tense.
- Use the imperative mood for commands.

For more information on ReStructuredText syntax, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html). In this documentation, we use `=` underline for headings, `-` underline for subheadings, and `^` underline for subsubheadings.

We also use the following extensions:

- `sphinxcontrib.bibtex` for managing bibliographies (see [docs](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
- `sphinxcontrib.openapi` for rendering OpenAPI specifications (see [docs](https://sphinxcontrib-openapi.readthedocs.io/))

All bibliographical references should be added to the [`references.bib`](docs/references.bib) file in the `docs` directory. A record need to contain all required fields according to the [BibTeX format](https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/).

The code style is captured using [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/), see [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file. Please ensure that your editor supports EditorConfig. It is also checked using CI together with the absence of warnings.

### Building the Documentation

First, install the required dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

to activate the env in windows use the cmd and venv\Scripts\activate.bat 
```bash
python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can build the documentation using the following command:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

Once built, you can view the documentation by opening the `index.html` file in the `_build/html` directory in a web browser.

## Way of Working

The following part describes the way of working when contributing to the documentation. Always also comply to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing.

### Commit Messages

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification when writing commit messages. This will help us to automatically generate the changelog.

For instance, the following commit message:

```
feat: add new extension to the documentation
docs: update framework general description
deps: update dependencies
fix: correct typos
```

### Branching and Pull Requests

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository (if not in the OSTrails organization).
2. Create a new branch for your changes (base = `next`).
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push your changes.
5. Open a pull request to the `next` branch of the main repository.

Both `next` and `main` branches are protected and require a review before merging. The `next` branch is used for the next release, while the `main` branch is used for the current release (and only release/hotfix PRs will be merged according to [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).

### Crediting Contributors

We will credit all contributors in the documentation. If you would like to be credited, please add your name and related information to the [`CONTRIBUTORS.yml`](./CONTRIBUTORS.yml) file.

Then, you can add your name to the list of contributors for a specific page (under the first heading) using the `page-authors` directive:

```rst
