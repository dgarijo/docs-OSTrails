^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FAIROs is a FAIR assessment tool for [Research Objects](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/). The tool uses external tools such as [F-UJI](https://f-uji.net/), [FOOPS](https://w3id.org/foops/) and [RSFC](https://github.com/oeg-upm/rsfc) to assess datasets, ontologies and software. The catalog contains the metrics and tests used to evaluate Research Objects. The source code with the FTR specification is in the branch dev-ostrails.
