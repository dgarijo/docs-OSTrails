OSTrails Application Profile for maDMPs
=======================================

OSTrails Application Profile (AP) as a tailored extension of the `RDA DMP Common Standard (DCS) for maDMPs <https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard>`_ will be designed to enhance interoperability while addressing various requirements (e.g. funders). Technically, the specification of the application profile will be done as prescribed by the DCS (which will support such extensions) and will be part of the Commons as the description of data structure.
