OSTrails maDMP API Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

maDMP API Specification will build on top of the DSC and OSTrails AP and specify the operations and data exchange. We plan to materialize this in the form of OpenAPI specification (using the current version, currently v3.1.1. Again, this promotes adoption as OpenAPI specification not only documents the API but also provides a way to generate source code or other artifacts (e.g. tests) as well as check compliance.
