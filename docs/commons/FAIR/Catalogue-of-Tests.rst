FAIR Data Point
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FAIR Data Point software is maintained by a third party (the “FAIRDataTeam”). In OSTrails we utilize the FAIR Data Point (FDP) in its configuration as an “index”, using the 16.x releases of the software suite in DockerHub.  FDP Index is the first implementation of a test registry and will include many of the descriptions from the FAIR Champion and FOOPS!
