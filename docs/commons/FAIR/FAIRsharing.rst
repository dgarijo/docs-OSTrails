FAIRsharing Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FAIRsharing is a registry of standards, databases, policies and FAIR assistance conceptual components. Registration of FAIR principles/dimensions, metrics, and benchmarks within FAIRsharing allows human- and machine-readable integration of the FAIR assessment components within the wider research landscape, and is key to discovery of these resources as well as for the implementation of the tests themselves via the rich metadata contained within the registry. Rather than being a specific tool release, it is the extension to FAIRsharing with the new FAIRassist registry which is relevant to the other Commons resources described in this section.
