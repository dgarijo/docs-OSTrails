FAIR Champion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FAIR Champion is a general-purpose FAIR assessment tool intended to be used by all communities and for all digital objects. In this release, FAIR Champion is aware of the 22 FAIR Tests (below), but any test, from any provider, can be registered so long as the test generates a metadata descriptor compliant with the FAIR Reference Model defined by OSTrails. The OpenAPI interface descriptor for this release is only partially complete; the Champion has a variety of functions related to new test registration and benchmark registration that are currently pending decisions by the OSTrails project.
