FAIR Testing Resource Vocabulary (FTR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Definition
----------

The FAIR Testing Resource Vocabulary (FTR) is an ontology created to
describe the results of FAIR Assessment in a consistent,
machine-readable way. Its purpose is to help different FAIR assessment
tools communicate the same language for transparency and reusability.

FTR is the **application profile** of the assessment components,
acting as a reference model that extends W3C standards such as
`DCAT <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/>`_,
`DQV <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/>`_,
`PROV <https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/>`_,
and others to describe the different assessment components, such as:

- **Test**: Service, formed by an API and associated piece of code
  that implements a Metric, and is executed (by a FAIR assessment tool),
  retrieving a particular and standardised result.

- **TestResult**: Output of running a test over a resource. A test
  result should also contain provenance metadata about the process
  followed to create it. ``TestResult`` is represented as an extension
  of ``prov:Entity``. A test result points to the corresponding test
  through the ``ftr:outputFromTest`` property.

- **TestResultSet**: A set of FAIR test results, together with
  their respective metadata. Common metadata may describe the set. For
  example, if all results were run by a request to the same API.

- **TestExecutionActivity**: The action carried out by an agent
  calling an API in which a test (or set of tests) was run. The result
  of this activity is either a ``TestResult`` or a ``TestResultSet``.

- **Metric**: Narrative domain-agnostic description that a Test
  must wholly implement.

- **Benchmark**: Community-specific groupings of a set of Metrics
  that provide a narrative describing how that community defines FAIR
  for assessment purposes.

- **ScoringAlgorithm**: Piece of code that contextualises the sum
  of all test results for a given benchmark into a final quantitative
  assessment result.

- **ScoringAlgorithmActivity**: The action carried out by an agent
  calling an API in which a ``ScoringAlgorithm`` was executed. The
  result of this activity is a ``BenchmarkScore``.

- **BenchmarkScore**: Output of a Scoring Algorithm over a
  resource, generating the final score and guidance for the whole
  assessment.

FAIR assessment validation
--------------------------

FTR also includes `ShEX and SHACL files <https://github.com/OSTrails/FAIR_testing_resource_vocabulary/tree/main/development>`_
for the different assessment components, allowing you to validate your
FTR records against this representation using any RDF validator tool,
such as `rudof <https://rudof-project.github.io/>`_.
