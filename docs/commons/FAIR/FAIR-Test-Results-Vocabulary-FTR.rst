FAIR Assessment specifications and SHACL shapes (FTR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FTR is the first OWL implementation of the FAIR Reference model described in Deliverables D1.2 and D.1.4. The reference model extends W3C standards such as DCAT (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), DQV (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/) and PROV (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) to describe test results, test definitions, metrics, benchmarks, algorithms, dimensions/principles and their interpretation to generate a FAIR assessment score.

The code release includes the vocabularies, definitions, specifications in machine-readable format and a set of SHACL validation rules to ensure tests and metrics are defined according to the specification.
